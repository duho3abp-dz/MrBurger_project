## Project description


My very first project, completed from scratch as part of the training. First time I wrote HTML and CSS code myself. Unfortunately, I haven't mastered JavaScript at this stage yet, so I used third-party ready-made solutions.

By creating this project, I realized that development is mine, and I will continue to do it.
